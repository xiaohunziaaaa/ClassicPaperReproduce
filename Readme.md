This repository is created to implement algorithms of some classic papers in ML as well as algorithms in PRML.


It will be continuously updated as long as I am still doing research work.


The struct of this repository is not so good now, I will reorganize it when I finish all algorithms in PRML.

The codes of linear regression and linear classificaiton was written under the guide of [https://github.com/ctgk/PRML](https://github.com/ctgk/PRML)
